## Instructions & Work Snapshot: June 2024-July 2025

Our analysis of recent deal activity shows a striking concentration of expertise among a small cohort of lawyers. Just four lawyers have executed 40 deals or more during this period, while six have handled transactions worth $10bn or more. This concentration suggests that clients are gravitating towards proven performers who can navigate complex transactions with confidence and efficiency.  

The distribution of work across multiple top lawyers and law firms indicates that private capital clients are not exclusively loyal to single advisers. Instead, they appear to be assembling teams based on specific expertise, sector knowledge, and demonstrable track record.

This strategic approach to legal adviser selection underscores the increasingly sophisticated nature of deal-making in the Indian market.

### The Private Credit Surge  

Private credit values are experiencing notable growth, with the largest transaction in this period being the Shapoorji Pallonji group deal. This trend reflects the broader evolution of India's private capital ecosystem, where alternative financing structures are gaining prominence alongside traditional private equity investments.  

The scale of recent transactions is also noteworthy. Three lawyers have achieved an average deal value of $1 billion, highlighting the magnitude and complexity of the matters being handled. These high-value transactions demand not just technical legal excellence but also commercial sophistication and the ability to coordinate across multiple stakeholders and jurisdictions.  

### What the Data Reveals

These patterns point to a market where expertise is highly valued and concentrated, deal complexity is increasing, and clients are increasingly willing to work with multiple advisors to access the best talent for specific situations. The lawyers succeeding at this level are likely those who have mastered not just legal technicalities but the broader commercial and strategic dimensions of private capital transactions.

### Understanding What Private Capital Clients Really Want

The concentration of deals among elite lawyers raises an important question: what distinguishes these top performers?   

Our conversations with leading private capital clients reveal two critical themes that separate exceptional legal advisors from merely competent ones.  

**1. The Deal-Maker Mindset: Why commercial judgement now trumps legal perfection**

Deal activity in India's private capital space has faced significant headwinds over the past year. Valuation gaps have widened, geopolitical uncertainties—from energy market disruptions to shifting US political dynamics—have created caution, and increased regulatory scrutiny is stretching internal resources. In this environment, clients are increasingly frustrated with lawyers who treat every technical legal point as a battlefield.  

*"We expect lawyers to think like investors. Show commercial understanding, not just legal correctness,"* says Sri Ram Srinivasan from Bain Capital. This sentiment captures a fundamental shift in how clients want their advisors to behave. The traditional model of exhaustive legal protectionism is giving way to something more nuanced: lawyers who understand when to push and when to facilitate.  

Harsh Shah from Oiko Credit puts it even more directly: *"It's about who can balance negotiation toughness with a calm, constructive attitude. We value firms that do not escalate but resolve."* In a market where deal momentum is already fragile, clients cannot afford lawyers who add friction through over-negotiation of marginal points.  

This doesn't mean clients want their lawyers to be passive. Rather, they want advisors who can distinguish between issues that genuinely protect their interests and those that simply demonstrate legal thoroughness. Himanshu Dodeja from Blackstone emphasises the need for *"a strong, cross-functional team that can handhold the client through complex matters"*, a description that sounds more like a business partner than a technical lawyer.  

The firms that thrive in this environment will be those whose lawyers can operate with what Premji Invest's Vardaan Ahluwalia calls *"conservative approach and judgement"*—not timidity, but wisdom about where value truly lies. This requires emotional intelligence, sector understanding, and the confidence to advise clients on what battles are worth fighting.  

**2. The Data Opportunity: From information collectors to insight providers**

Another key theme is the gap between what clients believe is possible with data and what they're seeing from their law firms. The lawyers handling 40+ deals or $10 billion+ in transaction value have access to extraordinary comparative information. Yet clients report that this knowledge remains largely invisible to them.  

*"I want firms to show me trends—what's normal, what's not—from all the deals they see,"* says Karishma Dalvi from Blume Ventures. This is not an unreasonable request. Clients want context for their decisions: Is this valuation protection standard? Are these indemnity caps in line with market? How are similar companies approaching ESG commitments?  

Himanshu Dodeja from Blackstone is more direct: *"There needs to be an uptick in how firms use data. Right now, nobody is doing anything that impressive." This assessment should be a wake-up call for the Indian legal market. Clients are not asking for something marginal—they're identifying a fundamental service gap.  

The opportunity extends beyond simple benchmarking. As Jaitra Jani from British International Investment noted, *"If firms could use data to benchmark risk or ESG outcomes, that would add real value."* In India’s ESG-conscious investment landscape, the ability to show clients how their portfolio companies compare on governance structures, climate commitments, or social impact metrics could be an interesting differentiator for clients picking their firms.  

The challenge is partly technical. Many firms lack the systems to aggregate and analyse their matter data effectively. But it's also cultural. Vardaan Ahluwalia from Premji Invest observes that *"firms aren't open about how they're using data."* Even firms that have made investments in technology and analytics often fail to translate those capabilities into client-facing insights.  

Law firms that solve this puzzle will transform their value proposition. Instead of being engaged merely to execute transactions, they become strategic advisors who help clients make better-informed decisions by contextualising each deal within a broader market picture. This shifts the conversation from hours billed to genuine strategic partnership.

### What This Means for Law Firms

Both the market data and client feedback point toward the same conclusion: clients want their lawyers to behave less like service providers and more like business partners. The concentration of deals among a small group of elite lawyers suggests these top performers have already mastered this approach.   

For firms aspiring to join this elite tier, success requires:  

- **Commercial acumen**: Understanding the business logic behind deals well enough to know when legal perfectionism serves the client and when it hinders them.  
- **Emotional intelligence**: Reading the room, understanding when to push hard and when to facilitate progress, and maintaining composure even when negotiations become tense.  
- **Data literacy**: Building systems that capture institutional knowledge and translate it into actionable insights that help clients make faster, better-informed decisions.  
- **Transparency**: Being open about capabilities, methodology, and the rationale behind advice, whether on negotiation strategy or how data informs recommendations.  

The Indian private capital market is maturing rapidly. The concentration of billion-dollar deals among a handful of lawyers, the growth of private credit, and the increasing sophistication of client demands all point to a market entering a new phase of development.

The firms that will lead in this next phase are those that recognise these shifts not as threats to traditional practice, but as opportunities to become genuinely indispensable to their clients' success. In an environment where deals are harder to execute and every advantage matters, the lawyers who combine technical excellence with commercial judgement and data-driven insight will be the ones clients turn to first.
