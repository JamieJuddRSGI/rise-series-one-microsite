![The distribution of RISE Lawyers by firm.](IMG001.png)

The top five Resight India law firms currently dominate India’s private capital legal market. The leaders of these firms are dominant practitioners themselves.  

However, three law firm leaders are not included in the new RISE Lawyers list. They do still act for clients, but their leadership roles put them in a different category.

The exceptions to this are Haigreve Khaitan of Khaitan & Co and Nishant Parikh of Trilegal. They are included in the RISE list because both peers and clients felt they were still more hands-on deals than their three leadership peers: Zia Mody (AZB), Cyril Shroff (CAM) and Akshay Chudasama (SAM).  

For the latter three, their roles are significant, but more in the category of deal oversight.

**Haigreve Khaitan** is positioned as both firm leader and ranked practitioner. His approach combines comprehensive data infrastructure with hands on strategic guidance. Khaitan & Co's systematic collection of deal documentation, from NDAs to fully indexed "deal bibles", enables the firm to provide clients with comparative intelligence across their transaction history.  

The firm's "What's Market" reports analyse deal positions anonymously, offering competitive intelligence that helps clients navigate increasingly contested investment processes. This data-driven approach, combined with Haigreve’s overall more hands-on approach, may be one reason that Khaitan fields the highest number of practitioners in the Private Capital RISE Lawyers 50 list.

**Zia Mody** at AZB & Partners leads her firm to the highest number of partners in the top 10 positions in the RISE 50. Mody has personally mentored the four partners included here and created a private capital powerhouse, with Ashwath Rau leading the charge. Her mentoring mark includes stellar AZB alumni such as Gautam Saha at TTA, Harsh Maggon at Trilegal, and Abhijit Joshi at Veritas.

---

**Cyril Shroff** at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas (CAM) believes  technology can drive competitive advantage. He remains directly involved in complex deals but focuses on building institutional capacity.  

CAM made Legora available to all lawyers for diligence, drafting and negotiation insights. They have compiled market data on indemnity caps and negotiated clause positions for years, creating playbooks that inform current transactions. This infrastructure supports one of the firm's fastest growing practices.

---

**Akshay Chudasama** at SAM acknowledges his days as a hands-on practitioner have given way to more of a leadership role at the firm. He continues to make critical judgement calls on deals, however. The firm has also adopted an enterprise-wide AI solution in Harvey, and Akshay is focused on how senior lawyers scale their expertise without becoming bottlenecks.

Trilegal's performance presents a counterpoint to founder- led structures. With strong representation across the RISE 50, and Nishant Parikh and Harsh Maggon securing top ten positions, the firm is proving the strength of its all-equity partnership model. Nishant maintains deep client relationships with Blackstone, Carlyle, and KKR whilst co-leading the firm.  

Trilegal focuses on systematic knowledge building. It has developed comprehensive M&A trend analysis, breaking down deal elements from indemnity liability thresholds to warranty insurance adoption.Its early adoption of Lucio, an Indian AI company, has helped it mould generative AI solutions to its needs.
