### Artificial Intelligence and Technology Adoption in Private Capital Practices

Indian law firms serving private credit clients are at varied stages of AI adoption, ranging from cautious experimentation to strategic deployment. The landscape reveals a profession in transition, navigating between technological promise and implementation practicalities.  

Among the 90+ private capital lawyers interviewed for the Resight India private capital RISE rating, approximately two-thirds indicated some level of personal experimentation with AI.

The most common applications were contract review, due diligence preparation, and research assistance.  However, the depth of integration varied significantly, with firm size and internal capability creating marked differences in adoption.

A few large firms, including Khaitan, CAM, and Trilegal, all reported structured internal AI development, referencing proprietary technologies and workflows designed specifically for the practice’s requirements. Most other practices have demonstrated a willingness to adopt AI via third-party solutions, with the most common being Harvey, Lucio, and Jurisphere, however usage is typically confined to document review and information extraction tasks rather than drafting or more complex legal analysis.

Many firms also described variances in technology choices as client-driven rather than strategically determined – conservative where clients are cautious, and adaptive where clients mandate specific tools. Additionally, a small but significant minority of mid-sized and boutique firms expressed hesitancy to use any AI on their high-value work, citing concerns around data security, accuracy verification, and client acceptance. Overall, AI adoption remains uneven but progressing steadily, shaped by institutional capacity and comfort with accuracy and security.  

The client perspective offers crucial context. Leading institutional investors are receptive to AI adoption – but only when demonstrable value is delivered. Blackstone's willingness to *"pay a premium for firms that use AI effectively"* signals clear market demand, yet their observation that *"no one has really shown us that yet"* underscores the implementation gap. Premji Invest's emphasis that *"AI should be proactive and outcome driven, used for contract drafting, due diligence and meaningful review,"* reflects widespread expectations from clients that experimentation with AI results in meaningful benefit for clients.

Across many firms and clients, however, a persistent *"human oversight"*theme emerged. Karishma Dalvi of Blume Ventures says: *"AI is interesting, but I'd rather know there's a human sanity check at the end."*

The technology adoption curve in Indian private credit practices appears to be in an early-middle phase. While awareness is universal and experimentation widespread, truly transformative implementation remains limited. Oiko Credit's pragmatic stance - *"We don't care how you do it, AI or not, as long as it's accurate and quick"* - may best capture the current market reality: clients value AI, but only so far as it results in meaningful outcomes.

### Deal Data Use in Private Capital Practices

Indian law firms are increasingly recognizing the strategic value of deal data, however the commitment and capacity to build databases remains uneven across the market. And they are some way behind the international private capital practices at international law firms.

There could be a little list from FTIL of the firms who have scored shortlists through their deal databases.  

Khaitan and AZB, now maintain detailed databases tracking specific deal parameters such as indemnity caps, liability thresholds, and covenant structures across their transaction portfolios. Some firms conduct annual market trend analyses, examining hundreds of deals to identify evolving practices on key negotiation points. At the most advanced end, certain practices create client-specific *"deal evaluation sheets"* that map investment terms across a fund's entire India portfolio, enabling rapid benchmarking during negotiations.  

However, significant gaps persist between client expectations and firm capabilities. Clients report that while efficiency and technology use matter, most firms remain opaque about their data practices and fail to demonstrate how data analysis enhances their advice. One investor noted that *"nobody is doing anything impressive"* with data, while another expressed desire for firms to *"show trends—what's normal, what's not—from all the deals they see."*

The disconnect stems partly from confidentiality concerns, which some firms cite as barriers to systematic data collection and analysis. Yet forward-thinking practitioners are taking a leaf out their foreign peers’ books and finding ways to balance client confidentiality with knowledge sharing, using scrubbed data and anonymized benchmarks to provide market intelligence without compromising sensitive information.  

Many firms lack dedicated resources to populate and maintain databases, relying instead on partners to manually update systems alongside billable work. The most successful programs in law firms require specialized teams—whether knowledge management groups, strategy teams, or research units—that systematically capture deal learnings to make them accessible to practitioners.  

The opportunity is clear: clients want data-driven insights on market practice, risk benchmarking, and sector trends. Firms that can harness their collective experience and translate it into accessible intelligence will differentiate themselves in an increasingly sophisticated market.
