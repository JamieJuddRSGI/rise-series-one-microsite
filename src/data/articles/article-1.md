### What are we doing?  

RSGI has developed a new methodology to assess, rate and rank individual lawyers across any legal specialism. It is called RISE.

RISE is a proprietary methodology that assesses the qualities that currently define exceptional practitioners and will continue to separate them from their peers. It also captures what clients look for in their external counsel and will be regularly updated. 

The indicators are:

- **R**eputation in the market, consisting of three sub-indicators: peer and client recommendations, directory recognition and media profile;
- **I**nstructions, analysing the quality of their client base, and the volume and value of their work;  
- **S**ophistication of their approach to the business of law, including digital maturity, talent development and team leadership skills;
- **E**xperience, how their clients rate the experience of using them, including scores for their EQ, strategic thinking and network.  

RSGI researchers conducted more than 100 qualitative interviews with practitioners and clients across the Indian private capital landscape over four months. From an initial longlist of over 200 lawyers, we identified and evaluated 50 private capital practitioners, scored across nearly 20 indicators.  

### Who are we looking at?  

The ranking identifies 50 practitioners in India's private capital market based on measurable performance between June 2024 and June 2025. The methodology evaluates lawyers working across private equity, venture capital and the emerging private credit space.

### Why this list may surprise you  

The RISE 50 ranking is built on data-driven analysis of transaction activity and practitioner performance between July 2024 and June 2025. 

Some of the ratings may be surprising, as they combine quantitative and qualitative intelligence. For example, lawyers with strong reputations might have a lower score overall because the RISE rating also includes an instruction score, which captures how busy lawyers have been during a particular time period. 

RISE is also a forward-looking methodology. The 'sophistication' indicator tracks partner traits that are increasingly important in an AI-enabled world and arguably will become as critical as technical legal skill. These are the ability to combine technology and human skills, to leverage proprietary data and to create custom tools, along with the ability to lead, mentor and develop a team. The ‘experience’ indicator tracks how the business of law is transitioning from law firms that offer services to ones that offer ‘experiences’. This indicator looks at how clients feel about the experience of working with their lawyers: what are their EQ skills like? How strategic are they as thinkers? How well networked? 

We believe the RISE rating will become a key component in how partners assess themselves and their teams, becoming a tool that can drive performance. For clients, the RISE rating can help them track and keep up to date with the external counsel they know and those they see on the other side of deals – and, ultimately, help them decide whom to instruct.

India's private capital legal market remains less compartmentalised than its western counterparts. Practitioners typically operate within broader M&A or banking and finance teams rather than dedicated private equity, venture capital or private credit practices. As India's private capital ecosystem continues to mature, many leading lawyers have developed their expertise through banking or M&A before specialising in fund work. This list recognises those who have achieved sufficient private capital specialisation to be distinguished as practitioners in this field.
