### Domestic capital displacing foreign investment & the rise of Indian law firms  

India's private capital landscape is undergoing a transformation. For decades, foreign capital dominated the market, with international funds setting terms and offshore counsel often taking the lead on transactions. That era is ending. Today, homegrown capital providers are contributing impressively to deal activity, and Indian law firms have secured a consistent position at the table – a striking contrast with the state of play as little as 15 years ago.  

This is more than a cyclical rebalancing of investment flows. It is India’s growth story.   

India's economy is now the world's fifth largest and projected to become the third largest by 2030. The National Stock Exchange has surpassed London to rank seventh globally by market capitalisation. This is not just an investment destination that international players are watching; it is an economy generating its own gravitational pull, with domestic institutions, capital pools, and professional services firms rising to meet the moment.  

### The scale of domestic capital formation  

The numbers tell a compelling story. ChrysCapital's recent 10th fund close at $2.1bn stands as India's largest private equity fund-raising, signalling both deepening domestic investor participation and confidence in India's growth trajectory. Bain Capital's 2025 India report highlights similar momentum: Kedaara closed its largest-ever fund at $1.7bn in 2024.  

ChrysCapital's managing director captured the market's direction in a recent Financial Express interview: *"You may even see the first billion-dollar fund raised solely from Indian capital in the next five years."* 

This is no longer aspirational. Systematic investment plans (SIPs) from domestic retail investors now provide a structural cushion that the market previously lacked. Darshika Kothari of AZB & Partners explains: *“Even if foreign inflows slow, India has a strong domestic savings pool, led by systematic investment plans and supported by pension, insurance and retail flows, that now anchors our capital markets. Earlier, even a brief pause in foreign investor activity would trigger steep corrections.  Today, our own savers provide a level of resilience we simply didn’t have.”* 

The implications extend beyond capital availability. Domestic funds understand local regulatory environments, cultural nuances, and sectoral dynamics with which foreign investors often struggle. They can move faster, negotiate differently, and build relationships that create competitive advantage.  

### Indian law firms take the lead  

The professionalisation of India's legal market has tracked — and in some ways enabled — this capital market maturation.  

RSGI’s research shows that the top 40 law firms have grown in headcount by 39% on average over the past five years. Additionally, mid-sized to large law firms (the 18 law firms with over 100 lawyers in 2019) have grown in headcount by 26% on average. The five largest firms have expanded by 65%, going from 558 to 882 lawyers on average. Revenue growth has been equally dramatic, with firms reporting average annual increases of 36% over the past three years.  

There has been a parallel shift in project leadership. Haigreve Khaitan of Khaitan & Co. says: *"Project management is now completely left to top-tier Indian firms and lawyers — that has been a huge change from the Indian market with international private capital providers."* 

This represents a fundamental reordering of influence. Where international firms once controlled transaction strategy and Indian counsel provided local regulatory support, Indian firms now drive execution while international counsel, when engaged at all, play supporting roles. The sophistication gap is also narrowing.  

This evolution reflects necessity as much as capability. As Nandish Vyas of AZB & Partners notes, *"In a few cases, there are up to 10 to 15 private equity firms evaluating a single asset in a bid process"* which means clients need advisers who can move at domestic market speed and understand competitive dynamics from the inside. The challenge isn't simply that international firms lack on-the-ground resources. It's that intensifying competition among investors themselves demands legal counsel sophisticated enough to keep pace.

When deal windows are compressed and multiple bidders are circling the same target, execution speed and deep client expertise becomes as critical as legal knowhow.

### Blurred lines: control deals, platforms and private credit  

The shift in capital sources and advisory sources has had a major impact on deal structures, blurring traditional lines between private equity, venture capital and M&A transactions.

Ashwath Rau of AZB & Partners says, *"Financial sponsors are as active as strategic sponsors… They no longer limit themselves to minority deals; they are making big-ticket acquisitions of control, including in listed companies."*  This shift in strategy is echoed by Pranav Atit of Trilegal: *“Top-tier blue chip funds are all doing control deals. They have control funds raised specifically for control deals."*

Lawyers who built careers around distinct transaction types now find their mandates cutting across categories. A single client might pursue a minority growth investment in one quarter and a full acquisition the next. Deal books that were once cleanly segmented into PE, VC or M&A now reflect a messier reality, where structures overlap and clients expect their advisers to move seamlessly between them.

Platform-building through bolt-on acquisitions has become prevalent, particularly in healthcare. Nandish Vyas provides examples: *"Healthcare platforms owned by several private equity firms have been making bolt-on acquisitions of smaller hospitals or single speciality assets."*

There’s also been a significant uptick in the number of reverse flip deals. A reverse flip is a transaction in which an Indian company that previously moved its holding structure overseas relocates its parent entity back to India. A booming national stock exchange and a high-appetite consumer class has incentivised this return to India.

Winnie Shekhar of CMS IndusLaw notes that a few years ago, when India's capital markets were still developing, she worked with Indian companies to set up holding companies in US and Singapore. *“At that time, many companies were looking for better access to capital from abroad, but today with Indian capital markets, including our IPO ecosystem performing strongly in several areas compared to global peers, companies with established reputations or operating in niche segments increasingly see value in listing in India.”*

The market's newest frontier is private credit. "Private credit has really changed in the last 12 to 18 months as far as India is concerned,*" Nandish observes. Dr Siddharth Srivastava of Khaitan & Co charts its evolution: "Two or three years back, the private credit market was very 'stressed'/ ‘special situations’-focused. We have, however, seen rapid strides in the way the market has evolved in recent times. The private credit landscape now is not just limited to special or stressed situations — it is also looking at performing assets and exploring innovative structures to fund those."*

Critically, private credit is creating new practice demands. Mithun Thanks of Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. explains: *“By and large, in an Indian context – perhaps especially given its comparative emergence and historic/origin links to  the debt side – most of the early private credit work seems to be clustered around the banking and finance practitioners as opposed to the equity M&A/private equity folks. It's still very early days, of course, and will probably even out a fair bit, but at this stage, that is the state of play we have been seeing."*

### Geopolitical tailwinds and rising complexity 

Geopolitical instability is accelerating capital flows towards India. Raghubir Menon of Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas says: *“Global headwinds – Ukraine, Russia, China, Trump tariffs – [mean] everyone’s looking for a safe haven for capital."*

Winnie Shekhar of CMS IndusLaw adds: *"It's because of the shift of leverage in the geopolitical scenario in terms of trade and economics that the bets on India are getting larger, braver and bolder."*

Yet this opportunity comes with intensified complexity. Currency volatility, regulatory scrutiny and sector-specific challenges demand deeper expertise. Haigreve Khaitan warns: *"If it's a financial services deal, are you entrenched in financial services? Do you have sector knowledge? I don't think you can really be that top-tier firm without that sector knowledge."*

This is where Indian firms' local depth becomes decisive. Understanding how SEBI will interpret new regulations, navigating state-level infrastructure approval processes, or anticipating RBI policy shifts are not skills that can be parachuted in. They require institutional presence and relationship capital that only few domestic firms possess.  

Clients increasingly value firms that can deploy specialised expertise across multiple practice areas and sectors. The days of the skilled generalist or single-sector specialist are fading. Today's top private capital practitioners understand that complex transactions require bringing in the right expert — and having that expert within their own firm creates decisive advantage. As deals grow more intricate, spanning regulatory regimes, sectors and deal structures, clients return to firms not just for individual lawyers but also for institutional depth. Bench strength has become the differentiator.  

### Implications for the Indian legal market  

The convergence of domestic capital dominance and Indian law firm sophistication creates a rare moment of structural advantage. The market is no longer bifurcated between offshore deal leadership and onshore execution.

Indian firms are positioned to own the entire value chain.  

To capitalise on this moment, firms must:

- **Build sector depth**: Financial services, healthcare, infrastructure, and technology deals now require specialised teams with genuine industry knowledge, not just legal technical skills.  
- **Develop commercial acumen**: Clients expect advisers who think like investors — understanding when to push and when to facilitate, distinguishing material risks from legal perfectionism.  
- **Position for private credit**: Banking and finance practices must evolve rapidly to capture this fast-growing segment, which will increasingly define mid-market deal activity.  
- **Leverage institutional scale**: The platform deals and bolt-on acquisitions driving growth require co-ordination across practice areas and geographies that only sophisticated, well-resourced firms can provide. India's private capital market is no longer a satellite of global flows. The law firms that recognise this shift not as a trend but as a permanent reordering will define the next chapter of India's growth story.
