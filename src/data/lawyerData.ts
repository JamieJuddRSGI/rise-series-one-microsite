      'Nanditha Gopal’s practice at AZB & Partners includes a mixture of private equity and venture capital clients. Her instruction metrics demonstrate steady deal activity, but her real strength lies in the calibre of her clients, which split roughly 70/30 between international and domestic firms, including Peak XV, Tiger Global and Vitruvian Partners.',
      'Nanditha is well recognised across directories and in the media, while clients particularly value her communication skills and emotional intelligence. Her data fluency is also strong, supported by AZB & Partners’ recent adoption of AI platform Harvey, which is helping accelerate research and diligence, as well as the previously laborious process of collecting client-specific deal data.'

      'Gautam Saha\'s Top 10 reputation ranking stems from exceptional peer recognition, comprehensive directory acknowledgement, and extensive media profile across India\'s private capital market. His joint managing partner role at TT&A Advocates positions him at the intersection of private equity, venture capital and private credit, where his strategic oversight combines with technical excellence.',
      'His instruction volume demonstrates consistent mandates from premier institutional clients. While he has acted for many leading private capital investors over the years, in the 12-month period analysed, Gautam\'s client list was more limited. It included Setu AIF Trust, IFC and DFC. Gautam is known for the high-value, technically complex nature of his internationally-focused practice spanning M&A and structured financing.',
      'Gautam\'s practice stands out for a strong client relationship focus. His pragmatic negotiation skills, understanding of client objectives and strategic thinking distinguish his approach.'
